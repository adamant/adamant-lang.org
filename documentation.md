Since Adamant is still in early development there is very little documentation available. The best way to learn about it will be from posted code samples and articles.  An [informal specification](https://github.com/adamant/Adamant.Specification.Informal/blob/master/book.md) designed to also serve as an introduction is in progress and also serves as a usual introduction to the language.

An informal specification and introduction should be available soon.
